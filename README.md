# A-scalable-NFT-Art-Project-by-Indorse

1. Web crawled the cyperpunk 2077 and other exotic photos with similar style fashions to our product as the background for Generative Adversarial Network model.
2. Overlapped our product with the chosen background and then used the randomly generated ID to set the color grading for our background photo.
  - Common: 57%
  - Rare: 30%
  - Epic: 10%
  - Legendary: 3%
4. Used the trained GAN model to fuse the product photo into the background.
5. Based on the randomly generated ID, we differentiate the rarity of each product-background pair.
